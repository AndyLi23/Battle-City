Don't let them shoot your flag either: if that's hit, the game is over.

### Features

-Three difficulties: easy, medium, hard<br>
-Customizable guns and player colors<br>
-Levels can be added with a simple .txt file<br>
-Medium and hard difficulty uses BFS to find the shortest route to your flag, easy uses a randomly generated path
